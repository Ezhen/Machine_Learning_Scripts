# Machine_Learning_Scripts
All scripts built for the course of Machine Learning in the Univeristy of Li√®ge. To execute the scripts, it is needed to download the google repository of audio records (related to digits) and install the skilearn library for python. But the concept is in there.


These scripts were entirely built or highly and essentially modified by me within the frames of the Machine Learning course at the Uni of Liege (http://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~jmbegon/?ml2017_2018)
* Empirical_analysis_and_plotting_all_metrics.py / 
* KNeigbors.py 	/ K-Neigbours classifiaction
* Naive_bayes.py  / Naive bayes classification
* Ridge_regression_and_Support_Vector_Machine.py 	/ Ridge regression and Support Vector Machine regression with a kernel
* VoiceRecognition.py / The final examination chalenge - digit recognition (10 digit classes and -1 class for everything else - overall 11 classes)
* decision_tree.py 	/ Decision tree classification
* functions.py 	/ supplementary helpful functions
* logistic_regression.py 	/ Logistic regression
	
  
 These scripts which were provided in frames of the Machine learning course, I didn't make any changes there:
  * data.py 	/ creation of two sample classes, where each sample is a vector of two elements
  * plot.py 	/ plotting of those samples onto the 2D plain
